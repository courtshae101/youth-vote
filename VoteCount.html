            <h1>The Youth Vote: By the Numbers</h1>
            <p>ALooking at the states with top 20 largest youth populations, we there is a pretty even distribution of Demoncratic and Republican states.  Out of these eligible youth voters, we see a sharp decrease in people who actually vote in the 2016 election.  In 2018, a Midterm election year we see even fewer young people cast their ballots.  It is normal for not all eligible voters to cast their vote, for example in 2016 only 61.4% of eligible voters voted and in 2018 only 53% voted.  However youth voting numbers are much lower than the national average, 38% of eligible young voted and in 2018 only 28.2% voted.  Explore why there is such a drop off in the youth civic engagement factors section.
