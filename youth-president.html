                <span id = "youth-pres"></span>
                <div id = "mapText">Based on the Circle data for the 2016 election, out of all 50 states, only 14 States,Maine, New Hampshire, New York , New Jersey, Virginia, Kentucky, Illinois, Missouri, Iowa, Minnesota, Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada, and California, had the same youth choice for the Presidential canidate as the overall state choice.  Even more shocking is that if the youth vote had decided the election, 20 of the states would have voted for the Democratic candidate, and only 4 would have voted for the Republican candidate.  The national numbers were 30 Republican, and 22 Democratic. This large divide has to be taken with a bit of caution however since 26 states did not give data about the youth vote for the Presidential candiate, but still there is a clear shift to Democrat for youth voters compared to the national votes. This may be due to the fact that 18 to 23 year olds rank climate change, racism, and economic inequality as top issues according to Politico, which a align more with the Democratic agenda.</div>
